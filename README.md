## 🧾 Overview of Project

The "Flight Management System" project aims to transform traditional airline data handling into a modern, efficient digital solution. By integrating a GUI with a robust backend database, the system will:

- Automate manual airline processes
- Provide a **user-friendly interface** for easy navigation
- Offer **real-time access** to accurate and up-to-date flight information
- Enhance the reliability and responsiveness of airline operations

---

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies Used

- **Java Swing** – for building the GUI
- **NetBeans** – as the development environment
- **Oracle Database** – for storing and managing airline data
- **SQL Plus** – for direct database interaction and testing

## 🎯 Project Purpose, Scope & Objectives

### ✅ Purpose

To design and develop a scalable and centralized system to manage complex airline operations, including crew scheduling, flight details, and aircraft logistics, through efficient use of DBMS concepts and GUI.

### 🧭 Scope

The system includes:

- Real-time flight data management
- Automated crew scheduling and assignment
- Integration of aircraft and location databases
- User-friendly frontend for airline staff or admin interaction

### 🎯 Objectives

1. **Automate Routine Tasks**  
   Replace manual data entry and scheduling with a smart, database-driven system.

2. **Ensure Data Accuracy & Consistency**  
   Maintain a single source of truth using DBMS integrity constraints and validations.

3. **Optimize Crew & Flight Scheduling**  
   Improve crew utilization by efficient scheduling algorithms.

4. **Real-Time Updates**  
   Use triggers and views to reflect changes instantly in the system.

5. **Support Future Expansion**  
   Ensure the system can adapt to new modules or airline policies.

## 📚 DBMS Concepts Implemented

The project showcases extensive use of core DBMS features:

- **Triggers** – For automatic updates or validations during flight schedule changes  
- **Exception Handling** – Error catching for invalid operations or data inconsistencies  
- **Functions** – For reusable logic and calculations (e.g., time difference between flights)  
- **Views** – For simplified data presentation and access control  
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** – INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations  
- **DCL (Data Control Language)** – Managing user privileges  
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language)** – Commit, Rollback operations for safe data handling  
- **DDL (Data Definition Language)** – Table creation and structure modification  
- **DRL (Data Retrieval Language)** – SELECT queries for real-time information retrieval
